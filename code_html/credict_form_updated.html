<p>Include position of financial ratios vs. benchmarks, with explanation for significant variations. Compare
  estimates and actuals from last year and explain variances. Mention impact of contingent liabilities (as % to
  TNW) and note any audit qualifications from the latest audited balance sheet.</p>
<textarea rows="6" cols="100" placeholder="Enter your comments on financial indicators...">The DSCR for FY 2023-24 was 40.31, which was higher than the previous year (FY 2022-23: 35.17) due to better cash generation and working capital management. However, it decreased to 30.87 in FY 2024-25, indicating a potential increase in debt servicing challenges. The current ratio decreased from 1.66 in FY 2022-23 to 1.05 in FY 2023-24, mainly due to increased current borrowing and lease liabilities. The interest coverage ratio also decreased significantly from 50% in FY 2022-23 to 20% in FY 2023-24, reflecting lower revenue and profit from operations. The debt-equity ratio increased slightly, indicating new borrowing arrangements. Contingent liabilities were disclosed in the financial statements, but specific percentage impacts on TNW were not provided.</textarea>

  <h4>2.5 Comments on Adequacy of NWC</h4>
  <p>(Comments should also cover wide variations in sources & uses, if any, and reasons for the same.)</p>
  <textarea rows="5" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here...">The adequacy of Net Working Capital (NWC) is reflected in the company's ability to manage its current assets and liabilities effectively. As of March 31, 2025, the current assets stand at ₹18.65 billion, while current liabilities are ₹9.68 billion, resulting in a positive NWC of ₹8.97 billion. This indicates a strong liquidity position, allowing the company to meet its short-term obligations comfortably. The increase in current assets from the previous year is primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalents, which rose from ₹4.25 billion to ₹5.48 billion. The company has also managed to secure working capital facilities, which contributed to the increase in cash flow from financing activities. The variations in sources and uses of funds are mainly attributed to the proceeds from non-convertible debentures and working capital facilities, which were used to finance investments in subsidiaries and manage dividend payments.</textarea>

  <h4>2.6 Treatment Proposed to Meet Shortfall (if any)</h4>
  <textarea rows="5" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here...">There is no indication of a shortfall in working capital as the company has maintained a positive NWC. However, the company has strategically issued non-convertible debentures amounting to ₹17 billion to bolster its financial position and support investments in subsidiaries. This proactive approach ensures that any potential shortfall is addressed by securing long-term financing options, thereby maintaining liquidity and supporting growth initiatives.</textarea>

  <h4>2.7 Comments on Cash Flow</h4>
  <textarea rows="5" cols="80" placeholder="Write your answer here...">The cash flow analysis for the year ended March 31, 2025, shows a net increase in cash and cash equivalents by ₹1.09 billion, indicating effective cash management. Operating activities generated ₹2.95 billion, reflecting strong operational performance. Investing activities used ₹2.14 billion, primarily due to acquisitions of property, plant, and equipment, and investments in subsidiaries. Financing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of ₹0.29 billion, driven by proceeds from non-convertible debentures and working capital facilities. The company has focused on cash conservation, liquidity management, and interest cost reduction, optimizing the use of working capital facilities. The issuance of non-convertible debentures has facilitated investments in group companies, enhancing strategic growth while maintaining a robust cash position.</textarea>

      <h4>6.4 SWOT Analysis & Mitigations</h4>
      <p><strong>Strength:</strong> The company has a diversified business profile with operations across four continents and businesses in approximately 90 countries. It maintains financial stability through a strong balance sheet, ensuring access to internal and external funds for growth opportunities. Operational efficiency is achieved by focusing on both variable and fixed costs across all entities. The company has a significant market share and position, supported by strategic customer relationships and contractual tie-ups.</p>
      <p><strong>Opportunity:</strong> There is an opportunity to enhance cash position due to ongoing improvement in demand scenarios. Strategic partnerships and strengthening R&D can capture market opportunities, particularly in export markets like the United States and Kenya.</p>
      <p><strong>Weakness:</strong> The company faces competition and needs to continuously monitor import trends to adjust sales strategies and remain competitive. Process efficiency can be improved to further optimize operations.</p>
      <p><strong>Threats:</strong> Non-Performing Assets (NPA) and market and economic conditions pose threats to the company. Global geopolitical unrest, cyclicality of demand, trade tariff conflicts, and energy price fluctuations are significant risks. Geopolitical issues can impact strategic growth trajectory and stakeholder value.</p>
      <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> The company has formulated strategic plans and objectives for risk management, including a detailed risk management policy covering risk identification, mitigation measures, and business continuity plans. Efforts are made to scale up export markets and strengthen distribution networks. The company continuously reviews its risk appetite and strategy relating to key risks, including market, cyber security, product, and reputational risks, with guidelines, policies, and processes for monitoring and mitigating such risks.</p>
